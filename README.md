# üè¶ Credit Default Risk Forecasting: A Machine Learning Approach
 
## Project Goal
This project focuses on applying robust Machine Learning classification techniques to accurately predict the likelihood of a loan default (Credit Risk). The objective is to build a reliable risk model, evaluated using the F1-score, to enhance resource allocation efficiency and inform critical lending decisions in the financial sector.
 
## Context
Developed following my summer internship at **Zitouna Bank**, this project demonstrates my ability to transition practical domain knowledge into a **high-impact analytical solution** for financial risk management.
 
## Methodology & Key Results
- **Model Used:** Optimized **Random Forest Classifier** (ideal for high-stakes binary classification).
- **Evaluation Metric:** **F1-score** (Chosen for its balance between Precision and Recall, crucial for minimizing both false positives and false negatives in banking).
- **Final Result:** Achieved an excellent **F1-score of ~0.9575** on the test set.
